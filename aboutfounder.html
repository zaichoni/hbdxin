		<img src="pc3.jpg" width="35%">
		<p id="pa">So on the day right after valentines (February 15) , I used blue temporary hair dye because I was bored with my life. I also cut my bangs HAHAHAH and I kinda like the dora-ness of it all. The blue just made my hair look black, but it stained everything around me blue. Like it looked like I fingered an avatar HAHA. My fingernails were blue for almost 2 weeks, my bedsheets and pillow were blue, my keyboard and mouse were blue, my fox was slightly stained blue. I'm happy to report that the blue hair dye stains have stopped taking over my life and is fading :D</p>
		<br>
		<h3 id="h3a">Enjoyed Life :D</h3>
		<img src="pc4.jpg" width="35%">
		<p id="pa">Yes!!! be proud of me B)). I've attended a few Gforce classes and met some cool people. I also took up some more leader roles in group projects (its going fine but I'm slowly losing my sanity at the same time). I still talk to my friends, the good ones atleast.  And I've gone back to doing things that I always used to love. I think it was because I got a lot of time to heal and stuff, so I've been enjoying a lot more things than before. In my free time I play a lot of Roblox. For real, I'm a part time architect, engineer, and interior designer in adopt me. I'm building a house HAHA I wonder what you think about it. I'm also still rich in Royale High. I hope life is treating you well too. </p>

		<h3 id="h3a">Family Time!!</h3>
		<img src="pc5.jpg" width="50%">
		<p id="pa">Of course I will mention the best people ever!!! During February I got to see my family a lot :)). And yesterday, I wrote a letter to Kuya Nayel for the first time. Him and I are not really in letter-writing terms since we see each other everyday, but the letter was for his school thingy so I just said things that I don't usually say! The other day I had a good deep conversation with my mom late at night. I missed those types of convos, we used to have them a lot back then.</p>
